Purpose
Although merge sort shows the same execution complexity as quick sort, (i.e., O(n log n)), its practical performance 
is much slower than quick sort due to array copying operations at each recursive call. This programming assignments improves 
the performance of merge sort by implementing a non-recursive, semi-in-place version of the merge-sort algorithm.
